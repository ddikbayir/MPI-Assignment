                        Team Self Evaluation Form

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Richard Bull

 
B: Cai Weijie

 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 			24hrs	       24hrs	  	  	 
coding 	  	  	 	24hrs+	       24hrs+
writeup 	  	  	2hrs	       0hrs
planning (alone) 	  	8hrs+	       8hrs+
total (including meetings) 	Too much       Too much	


(3) Describe 
(a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
	I worked heavily on the message passing and Cai worked mostly on the matrix division.

(b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
	Although we were late, mostly due to me not being able to help on a critical day as I was in the ER, the assignment
appears to be complete. We have a minor memory bug though that we can't identify but seems to disappear as long as we pad
with additional memory.

(c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
your team worked together;
	I couldn't do any work because I was in the ER with a family member that had pneumonia, and Cai was out of town during
the break. So there were significant problems and it did not help much that this assignment was the hardest one in the class.

(d) the lessons learned from these events;
	Don't take classes that require team work during the fall. There are too many holidays.

(e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
	This is the last assignment. It really doesn't matter at this point ;\

(f) anything else that comes to mind.
	I need to sleep so badly.
